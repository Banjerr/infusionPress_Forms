{"name":"InfusionPress Forms","tagline":"Wordpress, meet Infusionsoft forms; Infusionsoft forms, meet a friendly option for submitting data.","body":"[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Banjerr/infusionPress_Forms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Banjerr/infusionPress_Forms)\r\n\r\n# InfusionPress Forms\r\n![Logo](https://github.com/Banjerr/infusionPress_Forms/blob/master/images/infusionPressLogo.png)\r\n\r\nBecause sometimes you just need a simple way to add an IS form, with sweet validation, AJAX submission, and custom \"Thank You\" popups with each form.\r\n\r\nNo more of this \"Log in to Infusionsoft, find the campaign that contains the web form, open the web form and navigate to the code, copy the code from InfusionSoft, log into WordPress, find the page you want, paste the code into WordPress\", only to have your users directed to a lame \"Thank You\" page which might even take them away from your site!\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nSuper EASY! Simply install the plugin, go to the settings page and authenticate your Infusionsoft app. Adding a form is as easy as picking your form from a dropdown, customizing your \"thank you\", and copying/psting the InfusionPress shortcode wherever you want it.\r\n\r\n### Activating The Plugin And Authorizing Your IS App\r\n![Activation](https://github.com/Banjerr/infusionPress_Forms/blob/master/images/activate.gif)\r\n\r\n### Creating Your First InfusionPress Post\r\n![Creation](https://github.com/Banjerr/infusionPress_Forms/blob/master/images/implemenet.gif)\r\n\r\n### Using The InfusionPress Shortcode\r\nThis will work in any post/custom post type/page/page-tempate (if you know how to use shortcodes in page templates, ;-) )\r\n![Implementing](https://github.com/Banjerr/infusionPress_Forms/blob/master/images/rewarding.gif)\r\n\r\n### End Result\r\nThis Wordpress install has no styling, just a CSS normalize. BUT check out how nice the \"Thank You\" popup looks. And it's RESPONSIVE!\r\n![Rewarding](https://github.com/Banjerr/infusionPress_Forms/blob/master/images/using.gif)\r\n\r\n# Support\r\nIf you need any help, please feel free to send me an e-mail <a href=\"mailto:admin@countryfriedcoders.me\">admin@countryfriedcoders.me</a> or you open an <a href=\"https://github.com/Banjerr/infusionPress_Forms/issues\">Issue</a> on GitHub\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
