# InfusionPress Forms

Because sometimes you just need a simple way to add an IS form, with sweet validation, AJAX submission, and custom "Thank You" popups with each form.

No more of this "Log in to Infusionsoft, find the campaign that contains the web form, open the web form and navigate to the code, copy the code from InfusionSoft, log into WordPress, find the page you want, paste the code into WordPress", only to have your users directed to a lame "Thank You" page which might even take them away from your site!

## Installation

Super EASY! Simply install the plugin, go to the settings page and authenticate your Infusionsoft app. Adding a form is as easy as picking your form from a dropdown, customizing your "thank you", and copying/psting the InfusionPress shortcode wherever you want it.

### Using The InfusionPress Shortcode
This will work in any post/custom post type/page/page-tempate (if you know how to use shortcodes in page templates, ;-) )

### End Result
This Wordpress install has no styling, just a CSS normalize. BUT check out how nice the "Thank You" popup looks. And it's RESPONSIVE!
